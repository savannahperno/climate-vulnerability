# climate-vulnerability
My first geospatial project using Python

Utilizing climate anomaly data from NASA (July 2024) and economic data from The World Bank (2023), I created a map that overlays both data sets. The weights of each dataset can be adjusted depending on the application, but this creates a starting point to look at the intersection of where global temperature changes have occurred and which countries are the most economically vulnerable. 

This project uses Python libraries like pandas, geopandas, and matplotlib to create the visuals. 

Three maps are generated when the code is executed:
1. Climate anomaly map showing where temperatures have deviated from the 1951-1980 baseline and by how many degrees C.
2. Countries by income group, as determined by The World Bank.
3. A map that combines these datasets to show the overall climate vulnerability of the populated portions of Earth. Vulnerability can vary across a single country due to the nature of the climate dataset.
